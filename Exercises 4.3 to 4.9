#Exercises 4.3 to 4.9

#4.3 = Use a for loop to generate a list of 1 to 20, inclusive
for value in range(1, 21):
    print (value)
#and if I had to just print all values in a neat line instead of individually
print (list(range(0, 21)))

#4.4 = make a list of the numbers from one to one million, and then use a for loop o print the numbers
#I'd prefer not to wait for that whole list to print out one by one so I'm just going to print the entire range at once
print(list(range(1, 1_0_0_0_0_0_1)))

#4.5 = Using he list of 1 to 1 million, use the min and max functions to make sure that it actually
#starts at 1 and ends at 1 million, then use the sum function to see how fast python can add 1 million numbers
print (min(list(range(1, 1_0_0_0_0_0_1))))
print (max((list(range(1, 1_0_0_0_0_0_1)))))
print (sum((list(range(1, 1_0_0_0_0_0_1)))))

#4.6 = Use a for loop to print a list of odd numbers from 1 to 20

turkey = (list(range(1, 21, 2)))
for turkeys in turkey:
    print(turkeys)  
#I was so stuck on the idea that I had to use modulo to find an odd or even value that
# I didn't immediately think about just starting the value on an odd number and skipping by 2 to only get odd numbers

#4.7 = Use a for loop to make a list of muliples of 3 from 1 to 30
for chapelle in range (3, 31, 3):
    print (chapelle)

#4.8 = Use a for loop to make a list of and print the cube of each integer from 1 through 10  
cubeworld = [int(value)**3 for value in range (1, 11)]
for cube in cubeworld:
    print (cube)

#4.9 = Use a list comprehension to generate a list of the same 10 cubes from 4.8
rubiks = []
rubiks.append([int(value)**3 for value in range (1, 11)])
print (rubiks)
